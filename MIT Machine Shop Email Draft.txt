Dear Sir or Madam,

We from the Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative are currently working on a cubesat design for a mission in lunar orbit, for which we will need a machine shop for fabricating parts and satellite assembly. We are still in the planning phase of the project, but we would need access in July and August 2015.

We would we be pleased to have an answer as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

The Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative Team
