Dear Sir or Madam,
We from the Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative are currently working on a cubesat design for a mission in lunar orbit, for which we will possibly want to use some products you are offering. We are still in the planning phase of the project, but we would like to know if there will be a chance of troubles with product aviability or delivery in this year.
About an answer, we would be pleased.

Kind regards,
The Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative Team
