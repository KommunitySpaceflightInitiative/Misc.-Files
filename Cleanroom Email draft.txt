Dear Sir or Madam,

We from the Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative are currently working on a cubesat design for a mission in lunar orbit, for which we will need a cleanroom for assembly. We are still in the planning phase of the project, but we would need access to a cleanroom for assembly before June 2016.

We would we be pleased to have an answer as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

The Kommunity Spaceflight Initiative Team
